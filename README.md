# Battle-of-Neighborhoods
This repository contains the code used to implement the Battle of Neighborhoods problem.\
It was completed as a part of the IBM Capstone Project on Coursera on July 31, 2020.\
Committed to GitHub on August 9, 2021.\
The aim of the project is to visualise, process and predict suitable neighorhood environments\
for immigrants into Scarborough District, Toronto - Canada\
based on real world datasets obtained from Wikipedia and Geocoder.\
• Web scraped and extracted data using BeautifulSoup and FourSquare API into dataframes.\
• Identified similar communities from available data using K-Means clustering algorithm.\
• Obtained Seaborn plots depicting trends in rent prices and school ratings across communities.\
• Visualised the favourability for immigration using Folium choropleth to give a better intuition.\
